### Server-Side Botting

* Players now have access to built-in server-side automation for certain tasks. Do ::scripts ingame to view a list of available botting scripts. Have an idea for a script you'd like to see? Fork the project, write it up and submit a PR! Also, please note more scripts are planned to be added in the future, this is mostly just the groundwork.
  
  * Important note: **Running a bot script WILL remove you from the highscores.**

# Core Changes

* Server now has better start/stop functionality. ::update will actually completely end the server process now so updating will be easier and smoother than ever. There is also no longer a possibility for players to log in "too early" as the networking doesn't get started until the server is completely up and running! 

* The server now makes use of RSA encryption

* Server has an all-new system for the grand exchange that attempts to address several major issues.

# Bugfixes

* Stats now drain/restore properly once again.

* Super Energy potions now restore the correct amount of run energy.

* Brine Sabre now has the proper animations and a handled special attack.

* Arrows and bolts are no longer allowed on Entrana.

* Warrior woman spawns added to varrock castle

* Fixed the hard leather crafting interface

* Fixed a bug with lost tribe that prevented advancing past Reldo.

* Fixed a bug where Sigmund could reset Lost Tribe progress.
